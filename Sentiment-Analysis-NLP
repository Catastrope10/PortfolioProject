Sentiment Analysis
The sample dataset consists of 1000 reviews from an unnamed restaurant. The aim is to predict the sentiment of the review(Positive or negative).

Process followed
At first, we need to do text cleaning. It involves:

Removing punctuations(In our case we will not remove apostrophe as it is used in negation words like didn't, isn't, etc, which shows sentiment)
Removing stopwords like articles, pronouns, etc. (Here we will exclude the stopwords that will indicate sentiments like no, not, etc.
Changing our case to lowercase
Stemming the words in order to get the root of the word. (This is done to optimize the sparse matrix that will be formed by the CountVectoriser)
Making the Bag Of Words Model by using the CountVectoriser class imported from skilearn.
Building any classification model.
Here I used three models:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
SVM


Conclusion
Logistic regression gave the best performance with 82% accuracy.
